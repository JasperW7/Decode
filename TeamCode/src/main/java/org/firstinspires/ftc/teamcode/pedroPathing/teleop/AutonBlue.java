 * This is an example auto that showcases movement and control of two servos autonomously.

 * There are examples of different ways to build paths.
 * A path progression method has been created and can advance based on time, position, or other factors.

     * (For Into the Deep, this would be Blue Observation Zone (0,0) to Red Observation Zone (144,144).)
     * Even though Pedro uses a different coordinate system than RR, you can convert any roadrunner pose by adding +72 both the x and y.
     * This visualizer is very easy to use to find and create paths/pathchains/poses: <https://pedro-path-generator.vercel.app/>
